# Roadtripper-API

## A simple API to create access token authenticated users
You can find the collection of endpoits here: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/f6d8809c0cc34e02ff92

First POST a new user with email and password and then POST a Get access token request with the same email and password to generate your access token and get data from the API.

You can use either staging or localhost enviroment from the postman collection.
Backend connects with a RDS instance with PostgreSQL DB.

Feel free to create a localhost Postgres DB, clone the repo and start a server on your localhost.

For questions just email me.

More endpoints coming soon.
